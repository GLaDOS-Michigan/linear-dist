Observation from today:

First Exactly-Once Protocol shouldn't be for a single instance,
even though that has a simpler implementation. Because: that requires
a contract with the client code. Instead, the contract should be
that the protocol preserves whatever set of linear objects the
client has brewed up. Now the contract is almost implicit: the
network protocol keeps the set constant across the network.
